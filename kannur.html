                <p>Being Kerala's first lighthouse ever and Kannur's only one, the Kannur Lighthouse is a pretty big

                    has been fully functional for over a century. The Kannur Lighthouse has a balcony with a light that
                    is lit as the evening breaks in to alert the seamen of the land. Treat the history buff in you and
                    visit this site to be impressed by its fascinating history, fall in love with its mesmerising
                    backdrop and be delighted by the impeccable view.
