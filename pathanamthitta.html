                <p>Pathanamthitta is one of the fastest-growing cities in India, and one of the first of its kind in the
                    country to go completely cashless in 2017. As part of a government initiative to support e-wallets,
                    the Pathanamthitta district collectorate office has rejected the use of cash 2017 onwards. This city
                    is also considered the seat of Hindu mythology, since its home to the Sabarimala temple, which
                    attracts millions of faithful devotees every year.

                <h3 class="text-center">Pandalam Palace</h3><br>
                <p>The Pandalam family was an off-shoot of the mighty Pandya dynasty, and in spite of being a small
                    faction, commanded great wealth and respect in what is now modern Kerala, albeit thousands of years
                    ago. The Pandalam Palace is maintained in their memory and contains mixed influences of Pandya and
                    Malabar architecture. The Palace is considered the childhood home of Lord Ayyappa, and is one of the
                    foremost Pathanamthitta tourist places.

                <h3 class="text-center">Aranmula</h3><br>
                <p>Aranmula, a UN heritage site, is famous for two things - the boat race and the Aranmula Parthasarathy
                    Temple. Then, you can also buy an Aranmula Kannadi, an intricately-designed metal mirror made using
                    a secret method that’s been passed down from over generations. It’s said to have a healing
                    influence. Next, try and plan your trip during the Vallasadya, which is a huge 70-item feast
                    celebrating the bravery and physical might of the oarsmen who participate in the boat festival.
                    There’s always another story around the corner in Aranmula, making it one of the best places to
                    visit in Pathanamthitta.

                <h3 class="text-center">Thriveni Sangamam</h3><br>
                <p>Hindus believe that rivers originating from holy places have a cleansing effect, and a dip in one
                    will erase all the sins in the past. Now, that depends on how much of a believer you are, but at
                    Thriveni Sangamam, there’s one thing for sure - it’s one of the most breathtaking places to visit in
                    Pathanamthitta. It is a confluence of three rivers - the Pamba River Manimala River and the
                    Achankovil River, all deeply connected with Sabarimala. A dip into the refreshing waters will
                    definitely wipe away your tiredness, and maybe, a few sins here and there.

                    Pathanamthitta, especially because it’s a very well-organised forest resort with excellent guides
